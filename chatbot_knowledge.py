    # Basic Information about Alzheimer's
    "what is alzheimer": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die. It's the most common cause of dementia, affecting memory, thinking, and behavior. Currently, there is no cure, but treatments can help manage symptoms.",
    "what is alzheimers": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die. It's the most common cause of dementia, affecting memory, thinking, and behavior. Currently, there is no cure, but treatments can help manage symptoms.",
    "alzheimer definition": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out simple tasks. It typically develops slowly and worsens over time.",
    "what causes alzheimer": "The exact cause of Alzheimer's is not fully understood, but it involves a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Age is the biggest risk factor, and family history also plays a role. Other factors include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and head injuries.",
    "alzheimer causes": "The exact cause of Alzheimer's is not fully understood, but it involves a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Age is the biggest risk factor, and family history also plays a role. Other factors include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and head injuries.",

    # Early Signs and Symptoms
    "early signs of alzheimer": "Early signs of Alzheimer's include memory loss that disrupts daily life, challenges in planning or solving problems, difficulty completing familiar tasks, confusion with time or place, trouble understanding visual images, problems with words in speaking or writing, misplacing things, decreased judgment, withdrawal from work or social activities, and changes in mood and personality.",
    "alzheimer symptoms": "Common Alzheimer's symptoms include memory loss, confusion, difficulty with familiar tasks, problems with language, disorientation, poor judgment, mood changes, personality changes, loss of initiative, and in later stages, difficulty swallowing, walking, and speaking.",
    "memory loss alzheimer": "Memory loss in Alzheimer's typically starts with recent events and progresses to include important personal information, familiar people, and eventually basic skills. Unlike normal age-related forgetfulness, it significantly disrupts daily life.",
    "forgetfulness vs alzheimer": "Normal forgetfulness might involve occasionally forgetting names or appointments but remembering them later. Alzheimer's-related memory loss is more severe, persistent, and affects daily functioning. People with Alzheimer's may forget important dates, ask the same questions repeatedly, or need constant reminders.",

    # Risk Factors
    "alzheimer risk factors": "Major risk factors for Alzheimer's include age (65+), family history, genetics (APOE-e4 gene), cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, smoking, depression, low education level, physical inactivity, poor diet, head injuries, and social isolation.",
    "age and alzheimer": "Age is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's. The likelihood doubles every 5 years after age 65. After age 85, the risk reaches nearly 50%. However, early-onset Alzheimer's can occur in people as young as their 30s or 40s.",
    "family history alzheimer": "Having a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with Alzheimer's increases your risk 2-3 times. Certain genes like APOE-e4 can be inherited and significantly increase risk. However, not everyone with these genes develops Alzheimer's.",
    "genetics alzheimer": "While Alzheimer's isn't directly inherited like some diseases, certain genes increase risk. The APOE-e4 gene variant is the strongest genetic risk factor. Other genes like APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 are linked to early-onset Alzheimer's.",

    # Prevention and Lifestyle
    "prevent alzheimer": "While there's no guaranteed prevention, you can reduce risk through regular exercise, healthy diet (Mediterranean-style), staying mentally active, social engagement, quality sleep, stress management, avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and maintaining a healthy weight.",
    "exercise alzheimer": "Regular physical exercise can reduce Alzheimer's risk by 50%. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week, plus strength training. Exercise improves blood flow to the brain, reduces inflammation, and promotes growth of new brain cells.",
    "diet alzheimer": "A brain-healthy diet includes fatty fish (salmon, sardines), berries, leafy greens, nuts, olive oil, whole grains, and limited red meat and sweets. The Mediterranean and DASH diets are particularly beneficial for brain health.",
    "brain games alzheimer": "Mental stimulation through puzzles, reading, learning new skills, and social activities helps build cognitive reserve. Activities like crossword puzzles, Sudoku, chess, and learning a musical instrument or language are beneficial.",

    # Diagnosis and Testing
    "alzheimer diagnosis": "Alzheimer's diagnosis involves medical history review, physical and neurological exams, cognitive tests, blood tests to rule out other conditions, brain imaging (MRI, CT, PET scans), and sometimes spinal fluid analysis. Early diagnosis allows for better treatment planning.",
    "alzheimer test": "Common Alzheimer's tests include the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), clock drawing test, memory tests, and language assessments. These help evaluate memory, attention, language, and visuospatial skills.",
    "cognitive assessment alzheimer": "Cognitive assessments for Alzheimer's evaluate memory, attention, language, executive function, and visuospatial skills. These tests help detect early cognitive changes and track disease progression over time.",

    # Treatment and Management
    "alzheimer treatment": "While there's no cure for Alzheimer's, treatments include medications (cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil, memantine), lifestyle modifications, cognitive training, behavioral interventions, and support for daily living. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and maintaining quality of life.",
    "medication alzheimer": "Common Alzheimer's medications include cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil/Aricept, rivastigmine/Exelon, galantamine/Razadyne) which help with memory and thinking, and memantine/Namenda which regulates glutamate activity. These can help manage symptoms but don't stop disease progression.",
    "natural treatment alzheimer": "Natural approaches that may help include regular exercise, Mediterranean diet, cognitive training, social engagement, stress reduction, quality sleep, and supplements like omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and B vitamins (under medical supervision).",

    # Stages of Alzheimer's
    "alzheimer stages": "Alzheimer's has three main stages: Early (mild) - memory loss, confusion, mood changes; Middle (moderate) - increased memory loss, personality changes, need for assistance; Late (severe) - loss of awareness, difficulty communicating, need for full-time care.",
    "early stage alzheimer": "In early-stage Alzheimer's, people can still function independently but may experience memory lapses, difficulty finding words, challenges with complex tasks, and mood changes. They may still drive, work, and participate in social activities.",
    "middle stage alzheimer": "Middle-stage Alzheimer's involves increased confusion, memory loss, personality changes, wandering, agitation, and need for assistance with daily activities like dressing and bathing. People may still recognize familiar people but need more support.",
    "late stage alzheimer": "Late-stage Alzheimer's involves severe memory loss, loss of awareness of surroundings, difficulty communicating, incontinence, swallowing problems, and need for 24-hour care. People become completely dependent on caregivers.",

    # Caregiving and Support
